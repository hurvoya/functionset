This section focuses on the identification and documentation of the data used throughout the project.
It aims to provide a clear and structured view of the data sources, fields, and definitions required to support the analyses and dashboard development.
The Data Dictionary plays a key role in this section, ensuring data transparency, consistency, and traceability by documenting where the data comes from, how it is used, and how it should be interpreted.
