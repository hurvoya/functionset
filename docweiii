Framing – Introduction

The Framing phase aims to support business teams in clearly articulating and refining their needs. Its primary objective is to ensure a shared understanding of the business problem, define the scope and expected outcomes, and establish how the value generated by the use case will be measured. This includes identifying the key performance indicators (KPIs) that will be used to estimate the return on investment and assess the use case’s impact.

During this phase, two categories of deliverables are produced.
Input deliverables consist mainly of the initial scoping documents pre-filled by the business stakeholders.
Output deliverables include the validated functional specifications, the fully completed scoping documentation, and the formal approval to initiate the use case.



  Data Preparation – Introduction

The Data Preparation phase focuses on transforming raw data into clean, reliable, and well-understood datasets that can effectively support the development of the use case. This step involves exploring and understanding the available data sources, preparing and structuring the data, and documenting the resulting data model to ensure transparency and reusability. The goal is to deliver a solid and trusted data foundation that aligns with the business objectives defined during the Framing phase.

The input deliverables for this phase are the validated Framing documentation, including the formalized KPI that will later be used to measure the use case’s value.
The output deliverables consist of fully prepared and documented datasets, including the data model, the data dictionary, and a comprehensive data quality assessment.



Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Introduction

The Exploratory Data Analysis phase aims to deeply understand and analyse the prepared datasets from a business-oriented perspective. Beyond the technical exploration, this step focuses on uncovering meaningful patterns, validating assumptions, and generating insights that can be shared and discussed with business stakeholders. The objective is to build a strong, shared understanding of the data, support interpretation through clear visualisations and explanations, and ensure that any observations are validated by the business.

The input deliverables for this phase are the prepared datasets and all associated documentation produced during Data Preparation.
The output deliverables include the full EDA package: descriptive statistics, multivariate analyses, and visualisations, along with a structured synthesis of the insights derived from the analysis. This synthesis should highlight key observations, business interpretations, and stakeholder feedback. Ultimately, the EDA phase concludes with the business validation of the analytical findings.




  Solution Development – Introduction

The fourth phase focuses on designing and delivering the final solution of the use case. Depending on the nature of the use case, this phase can take two forms: model development for Data Science initiatives, or product development (e.g., dashboards or analytical deliverables) for Data Analytics use cases. In both cases, the goal is to move from insights and exploratory findings to a fully operational, documented, and validated solution that provides tangible business value.

The input deliverable for this phase is the complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) package, including validated insights, datasets, and documentation.

1. Modelling (Data Science Use Cases)

The Modelling phase aims to design, train, and evaluate a machine learning or AI model that addresses the business need defined earlier in the process. This includes selecting the appropriate modelling approach, engineering features, training and tuning models, and assessing performance using the KPIs and metrics defined during Framing. A major focus of this phase is ensuring explainability, robustness, and alignment with business expectations.

Beyond developing the model, this step also involves documenting the modelling choices, performance results, limitations, and recommended next steps (e.g., deployment strategy, monitoring considerations, or further improvements).

Output deliverables typically include:

the trained and evaluated model,

model documentation (features, methodology, algorithms used),

performance report with business-aligned metrics,

explainability elements (variable importance, model behaviour, etc.),

recommendations for deployment or operationalisation.

2. Solution Development (Data Analytics Use Cases)

For Data Analytics use cases, this phase focuses on developing the analytical product that will deliver insights to the business—commonly in the form of a dashboard, reporting solution, or structured analytical conclusions. This involves building the dashboard structure, selecting relevant indicators, designing visualisations, and ensuring clarity, usability, and business relevance.

Detailed documentation is also produced to describe how the dashboard or analytical product was built, the logic behind each KPI, the filters and segments available, and any methodological considerations.

Output deliverables typically include:

the final dashboard or analytical product,

documentation detailing the metrics, business rules, and design choices,

usage guidelines or business readout if needed.




  Pilot Phase – Introduction

The Pilot phase aims to evaluate the developed solution in a controlled, real-world environment. This stage ensures that the model or analytical product performs as expected, meets business needs, and aligns with the objectives defined during the Framing phase. The goal is to validate relevance, usability, performance, and overall business value before moving to broader deployment or operationalisation.

The input deliverable for this phase is the complete solution developed during the previous step—whether a predictive model or an analytical dashboard.

During the Pilot, several elements are assessed and documented: how the pilot was conducted, which teams participated, how users interacted with the solution, and the key questions or hypotheses being tested.
For Data Science use cases, the focus is on validating the model’s behaviour: ensuring predictions make sense, confirming performance on real operational data, and checking the stability and interpretability of results.
For Data Analytics use cases, the emphasis is on ensuring that the dashboard or analytical product effectively supports the intended business decisions and reflects expectations defined during Framing and EDA.

The output deliverables include a structured pilot follow-up: business feedback, usage analysis, issues or refinements identified, and the formal validation of the pilot results. This validation represents the final step before deciding whether to scale, industrialise, or iterate on the solution.




Industrialisation Phase – Introduction

The Industrialisation phase focuses on transitioning the use case from a research and development environment into a fully operational, production-grade solution. This step is carried out in close collaboration with the Stellar industrialisation teams to ensure that the entire value chain—from data ingestion to model execution or dashboard refresh—is reliable, automated, and fully controlled.

The objective of this phase is to design a robust and repeatable process that guarantees consistent delivery of results. This includes implementing automated data pipelines, scheduling model runs or dashboard updates, integrating monitoring mechanisms, and ensuring that the underlying data sources are part of the trusted, industrialised environment.

A key aspect of this phase is documentation: ensuring that business concepts, data definitions, and usage rules are clearly formalised through artefacts such as business data dictionaries. This ensures transparency, proper governance, and alignment between technical implementation and business understanding.

Ultimately, industrialisation ensures that the use case can run autonomously, at scale, with clear quality controls and full traceability, providing a stable and sustainable solution that can support business operations over time.
