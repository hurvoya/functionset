The Pilot Organization section describes how the pilot phase is structured and executed. It outlines the pilot strategy, including the scope, the selected participants or teams, and the operational approach used to test the solution in real conditions. This section should also specify the expected outcomes of the pilot, its duration, key milestones, and the criteria used to evaluate success. Overall, it provides a clear overview of how the pilot is organised, what it aims to validate, and how the results will inform the next steps of the use case.
