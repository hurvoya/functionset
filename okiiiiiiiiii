The objective of this phase is to ensure the reliability, completeness, and consistency of the data used throughout the project. It includes conducting a series of quality checks and analyses, documented in the Data Quality Statistics deliverable, which provides a clear overview of the current state of the data. In parallel, the Data Quality Rule Inventory captures and tracks the set of rules defined to monitor and maintain data quality over time, ensuring that critical fields and datasets meet the required standards. Together, these deliverables provide a structured framework to assess, control, and continuously improve data quality.
