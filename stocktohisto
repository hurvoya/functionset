Slide 1 – Current Context
Dashboard Objective:

Strengthen performance management within operational teams by defining effective indicators usable across all countries to set action plans.

Serve as support in discussions:

Between countries and Corporate (e.g., SPOCs for Pay Out and Global Head)

Locally within countries (Ops and BUs)

Enable Top Management to have a clear view of Pay Out activity across countries/BUs

Measure the service level while ensuring mutual commitments and satisfaction of Dealers/Clients.

How:

Creation of key information enabling effective performance tracking against set targets.
E.g.: volume, right resources in the right place, operational efficiency, Dealer/client service on time, respect of lead times, productivity; risk KPIs tracking is out of scope.

Take into account the specificities of each country/IBL.

Slide 2 – Objectives
"Exit" current data preparation processes in view of SAS decommissioning (Reco Audit)

Retrieve data at the source, in Dataiku, and conduct data quality analysis

Document and validate the different rules applied to data

Optimize current dashboards to facilitate analysis, integrate organizational changes (TOM) and support decision-making

Slide 3 – Evolution Lot #1
Review the current context considering the clarifications/changes below.

KPI Evolution:

Evolve productivity calculations → pooling of current team data: present historical data

Include volume trends → track current year volumes vs previous year

Manage history when contexts change → Variable SLA with changing validity periods

Dashboard Readability Evolution:

Create a summary page per country and ease access to various dashboard data

Split user-usage

Add relevant business filters that can be easily implemented due to data availability (e.g., Market/Partners)

New Scope:

Integrate specific KPIs for BU BLS – excluding Real Estate → if successful, extend to BEL and Italy

Data Access:

Add a dedicated tab with request details + KPIs to ease extractions (implementation dependent on dashboard weight) → aim: deeper “country-level analysis”

Slide 4 – Next Step
Delivery of Lot #1 for testing: End of June 2025

Prioritization and implementation of Lot #2: To be defined

Extend the dashboard to other countries excluding PFE

Retrieve KPIs produced autonomously by countries
e.g.: PFE not using BPM (like ITA or ELS-DEU)

Refine No Touch indicators (strong demand from countries to distinguish internal vs external touch)

FTE data source (working days, FTE) → capture some data automatically

For BPM lead times display, consider calculating median vs average from Spotfire, which can misrepresent reality

Direct BPM access for countries to avoid manual Spotfire extractions
